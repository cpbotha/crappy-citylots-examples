# truly crappy little citylots.json parsing examples

[Louis Brauer](https://emacs.ch/@louis) put together [a collection of
programming language examples that parse a 190MB json
file](https://emacs.ch/@louis/110056755830060189) into native data structures.

This repo contains my silly attempts in nim (x2), Python with orjson, ocaml and
his fast C implementation for comparison.

In each of these cases, there should be enough info in the comments so you can
build and run.
